# TODO List

**Last Updated:** 2026-10-07 (docs-health harvest from the 2026-08-12 reliability series + seven 2026-10-07 reports)

Short- and mid-term actionable work. Each item is scoped — pick one, do it, tick
the box. An item lives here only when it is bounded and estimable; vague or
long-term ideas live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Completed work is recorded in
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), never here.

---

## Urgent

- [ ] **Ubuntu 26 runner migration audit — deadline 2026-10-12** — GitHub is
      migrating `ubuntu-latest`; warnings already appear in every run log.
      Audit all workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) for runner-compat
      breakage and pin or adapt.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §f22, 2026-10-07_02-24 §f11`)

## Testing & Platform

- [ ] **Windows CI matrix** — add a `windows-latest` job to `ci.yml` that runs
      `go test ./...`. Windows has different event semantics (no inotify);
      document any platform-specific skips.
- [ ] **macOS CI matrix for case-insensitive verification** — the case-
      sensitivity and NFD/NFC behavior is verified as _logic_ on Linux
      (case-sensitive ext4). Real APFS behavior (case-only rename coalescing,
      NFD event paths) is only provable on macOS. Add a `macos-latest` job or
      document the limitation explicitly. (See ROADMAP → Platform Coverage.)
- [ ] **Expand fuzz tests** — current corpus covers `FilterRegex`,
      `FilterExtensions`, `FilterIgnoreGlobs`, `OpUnmarshalText`, `FilterMinSize`,
      and `PathKey` (NFC/idempotency/case-folding). Add fuzzers for
      `FilterAnd`/`FilterOr`/`FilterNot` composition, `Event` JSON round-trip,
      the gitignore matcher, `FilterIgnoreDirsCaseInsensitive`, and
      `MiddlewareDeduplicateCaseInsensitive`.
      (`src: 2026-08-12_19-22 §f16`)
- [ ] **Large-tree stress harness** — synthetic 100k-directory fixture that
      validates batched registration, budget enforcement, and self-heal under
      load.
- [ ] **Test: `WithContentHashing()` + `WithContentHashMaxSize(0)` interaction** —
      pin the (currently undocumented) semantics of combining both options;
      the interaction is debatable and should be a tested decision.
      (`src: 2026-08-12_19-22 §F8, §G1`)
- [ ] **Test: `Stats.WatchBudgetCap == Stats.WatchLimit` when fraction is 1.0** —
      end-to-end guard that the default (no safety fraction) never reduces the
      detected limit.
      (`src: 2026-08-12_19-22 §F9`)
- [ ] **Test: `ErrorContext.Event` population** — the field is populated on
      handler/middleware error paths (added in the v2.4.0 lint fix) but untested.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f13`)

## CI & Release Hardening

- [ ] **CI guard: go-directive floor** — fail the build if `go.mod`'s `go`
      directive ≠ `1.26.7` (or exceeds the CI matrix version). Three incidents
      (2026-09-29, 2026-10-07 ×2) were caused by silent bumps; the buildflow
      skip-list is name-fragile, a CI check is structural.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f8, 05-17 §f36, 06-00 §f4/C5`)
- [ ] **Go 1.27 in the CI test matrix** — add alongside the 1.26 floor; pairs
      with the fleet Go-strategy decision (see open questions).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f9, 04-34 §f22`)
- [ ] **Required status checks on master + release PRs** — the v2.4.0 release
      PR merged while master was red; nothing structurally prevents that.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f10/c7`)
- [ ] **`release.yml` `workflow_dispatch` trigger** — the workflow is dead code
      for GITHUB_TOKEN-created tags (they don't re-trigger workflows); the
      manual path needs a trigger or its test+lint should fold into
      release-please flow.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f12/b3`)
- [ ] **BuildFlow binary upgrade + skip-list re-verify** — binary is `202b114`,
      BuildFlow HEAD moved past it; after upgrade re-run the pipeline and
      re-prove the three skips still resolve (provider renames silently
      unskip). Also triage the non-gating finding noise (9-tools-unavailable
      warning, go-auto-upgrade ×12, nix-checker ×8, nix-build-verify fate,
      vulnix CVEs) and file the two upstream BuildFlow issues once approved
      (see open questions).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §f7/B2/B3/C1`)
- [ ] **Re-capture benchmark baseline post-v2.4.x** — `nix run .#bench-baseline`
      on a quiet machine (AGENTS.md bench discipline: no parallel load).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f16, 03-09 §f17`)

## Documentation

- [ ] **Shrink docs-consistency exemption list** — the CI gate exempts 15
      symbols (11 phantom-type helpers + `WatcherStateFlags` +
      `WithWatchedIgnoreDirs` (deprecated) + 2 real gaps:
      `FilterGeneratedCodeFull` and `FilterGeneratedCodeWithFilter`). Document
      the two filters in FEATURES.md to reach zero real exemptions.
- [ ] **Split AGENTS.md to carrying capacity** — ~645 lines vs the doctor's
      220-line max; move File Organization table, gogenfilter API notes, CI
      Workflows table, and Linter Cheat Sheet to `docs/` with pointers. Every
      distinct concept must survive the move.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_04-34 §c1, 06-00 §f18/B5`)
- [ ] **Website deploy runbook** — document install → build → deploy via flake
      apps, the `trailingSlash: false` quirk, cleanUrls, and "verify built
      slugs before publishing URLs" (the v2.4.0 release-notes 404 lesson) in
      AGENTS.md or a RELEASE.md.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §f5/#30, 02-24 §e1/e5`)

## Website Maintenance

- [ ] **Fix website dependabot alerts** — `fast-uri` (high, host confusion) and
      `astro` (medium, reflected XSS) in `website/package.json`. Update with
      `cd website && pnpm update`. (`src: 2026-07-29_14-06 §Dependabot`)
- [ ] **Website CI build job** — `pnpm install && pnpm build` (+ `html-validate`,
      already a devDep) in CI; today website breakage is only caught at manual
      deploy time (hit twice on 2026-10-07).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §f2/#6, 02-24 §f24`)
- [ ] **Website link checker** — `html-validate` or an Astro dead-link plugin in
      the build; would have caught the migration-guide 404.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §f3`)
- [ ] **Post-audit website chores** — `pnpm dedupe` after the 2026-10-07
      lockfile churn; review the 7 `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries once the
      patched versions age out (see open questions); drop the
      `postcss-selector-parser` override when expressive-code bumps
      postcss-nested; document the override's existence; redeploy after dep
      updates; spot-check sharp 0.35.5 rendering on an image-heavy page.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §f5/#22/#23/#24/#36/#37/B4`)
- [ ] **Website small items** — add `editLink`/`lastUpdated` to astro.config if
      missing; consider gitignoring `changelog.mdx` (committed build artifact);
      check the OG image renders on social cards.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §f24/#25/#28`)

## Hygiene

- [ ] **Review/merge dependabot PRs #31, #32; close stale #14.**
      (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §f15/c4`)
- [ ] **Verify prettier's "3 fixed" daemon-committed files** from the 06:00
      buildflow run 1 (unreviewed auto-edits).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §f31`)
- [ ] **Run gitleaks + codespell once** — never run in the pipeline.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §f32`)
- [ ] **Clean /tmp evidence logs** once CI is confirmed green after this push
      (`/tmp/gfw-main-run*.log`, `/tmp/proof-run.log`, `/tmp/strace-*.log`,
      `/tmp/gomod-*.log`, `/tmp/bf-*.log`).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §f34`)

## Process debts (2026-10-07 docs sweep tail)

- [ ] **Read + annotate `2026-10-07_03-10_pr-review-ci-recovery`** — the one
      2026-10-07 report the sweep missed.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_08-14 §b`)
- [ ] **Run `check-rows.py` over all 86 archived files** — presence gate passed;
      row-uniformity gate not yet proven.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_08-14 §b`)
- [ ] **Content-verify DOMAIN_LANGUAGE / API_STABILITY / Troubleshooting /
      MIGRATION / ARCHITECTURE against code** (existence-checked only so far).
      (`src: 2026-10-07_08-14 §c2`)
- [ ] **Full `nix flake check` + verify second vendorHash (flake.nix:111)**.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §B6`)
- [ ] **Status-dir index** (`docs/status/README.md`: active reports + archived
      pointer) + CHANGELOG v2.4.0 cosmetic blank-line fix.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_08-14 §c5/c6`)
- [ ] **Cross-repo (crush-config):** commit `lessons.md` entry (instrument
      writers before racing them) + fix buildflow skill DB path
      (`buildflow.db`→`cache.db`) with fan-out verify.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_05-17 §f10, 06-00 §f9`)
- [ ] **v3 decision doc** — collect Q1/Q2/Q4/Q9 + micro-polish bundle into
      `docs/research/v3-decisions.md`.
      (`src: 2026-10-07_08-17 plan task 26`)

## v3 Candidates

- [ ] **Phantom-typed `PathKey`** — `type PathKey string` for compile-time safety
      on path keys. Currently keys are bare strings. Would prevent accidental
      mixing of raw paths and canonicalized keys.
- [ ] **`CaseSensitivityProbed` mode** — actually probe the filesystem (write a
      test file with mixed-case name, check if it collides) instead of relying
      on `runtime.GOOS`. More accurate for edge cases (case-sensitive NTFS,
      case-sensitive APFS volume).
      (`src: 2026-07-29_09-44 §f #27`)
- [ ] **Filesystem API micro-polish** — `Parse(string)` for
      `FilesystemCaseSensitivity`, a `CaseSensitivityConfigured` stat (vs the
      resolved-mode stat), a lock-policy doc note for
      `EffectiveCaseSensitivity`, a symlink-to-watched-path dedup test, and an
      `EffectiveCaseSensitivity`-vs-`Reset()` concurrency test.
      (`src: 2026-07-29_14-38 §f4/5/10/13/17`)

## Open questions (blockers, not tasks — need user decision)

These are **not** actionable until answered. They do not belong in the
checklist above.

1. **Is `.goreleaser.yml` dead config to delete, or an unfinished wiring task?**
   `release.yml` uses `softprops/action-gh-release` with auto-generated notes and
   has no goreleaser step. Now that release-please is wired in, goreleaser may be
   fully obsolete. Deleting it simplifies FEATURES (Cross-platform releases →
   not-planned); keeping it means it should be wired in eventually.
   (`src: 2026-07-26_18-39 §g Q2`)

2. **Should the benchmark baseline be committed (CI-enforceable) or stay
   gitignored (local-only)?** The baseline is currently gitignored per the
   original TODO, but the ROADMAP says "benchmark freshness CI." A gitignored
   file can never drive a CI regression gate. Machine-specific noise makes
   committed baselines imperfect, but they are the only way CI can catch
   regressions.
   (`src: 2026-07-26_21-00 §g Q1`)

3. **The `WatchChanges(ctx, targetState)` open design questions** (reporting
   granularity, closed-watcher semantics, depth reconciliation) live in
   `docs/research/watchchanges-contract.md`; the implementation becomes a TODO
   once those are answered.

4. **Should the `watchBackend` interface be exported?** Currently unexported
   (test-internal only). Consumers might want their own fake backends for
   integration testing. Tradeoff: more public API surface vs. more consumer
   value. This is a v3 decision — exporting it is a breaking commitment.
   (`src: 2026-07-26_20-00 §G Q1`)

5. **Should website deploys be automated from CI** (Firebase service-account
   secret on master push / workflow_dispatch), or stay manual-and-local?
   Determines the website CI job's scope.
   (`src: 2026-10-07_03-09 §g Q2`)

6. **File the two upstream BuildFlow issues?** (a) go-structure-linter
   auto-bumps the `go` directive mid-run (strace evidence ready); (b) result
   cache ignores `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm-audit (stale replay until TTL).
   Both are fleet-wide hazards; filings need your go-ahead since you own
   BuildFlow.
   (`src: 2026-10-07_05-17 §g Q1, 06-00 §g Q1/C1`)

7. **go-daemon ecosystem follow-ups** — mirror the "Related Projects" note in
   go-daemon's README (cross-repo edit), and choose the host for a
   `watcher-daemon` example: bump this module to Go 1.27, host in go-daemon's
   repo, or a sibling repo.
   (`src: 2026-10-07_00-42 §b1/g1/g2`)

8. **Are the 7 new `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries an acceptable standing
   supply-chain tradeoff** (trusting same-day patched releases), and when
   should they be pruned?
   (`src: 2026-10-07_06-00 §g Q3/B4`)

9. **Changelog policy for releases** — should future releases block tagging on
   curated changelog content (curate inside the release PR before merge), or is
   the tag-gets-stub/master-gets-curation split acceptable (as shipped for
   v2.4.0)?
   (`src: 2026-10-07_02-24 §g Q3`)
